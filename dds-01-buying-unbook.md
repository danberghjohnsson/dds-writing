__Buying an Un-Encyclopaedia__

_A Reality-based Example to Start with_

A Swedish business in the retail business put an order form online on their web-site. In reality this company was selling books so, let us say that they were.

The order form was the perfectly normal thing you expected. Browsing around the descriptions of books you cut put them in a virtual shopping cart. When finished you went to the checkout where you registered shipping address and paid using a credit card. 

For example, if you liked Encyclopaedia of Application Security and Domain Driven Design which cost SEK 449 each, you might put that in your cart. If you wanted you could also change the quantity to something else then one. If you liked four copies of the Encyclopaedia you changed the quantity in your cart and upon checkout your credit card would be billed SEK 1796.

One of the security testers probing the system got curious about the quantity field and started fiddling around with it. Trying arbitrary pieces of text gave various error messages on the theme "this is not an integer".

Inspired by this, in a creative moment the security tester tried changing the quantity to "-1".
